generator-hazdev-webapp
=======================

A web library generator for Yeoman used by the USGS Earthquake Hazards
Program "HazDev" team.

Getting started
---------------

- Make sure you have [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) installed:
	`npm install -g yo`
- Install the generator: `npm install -g generator-hazdev-weblib`
- Run: `yo hazdev-weblib`

TODO :: Update getting started to be more clear/complete.

Road Map
--------

Here are the list of things to be done on this generator. They will probably
only be implemented as needed unless there is copious amounts of free time made
available.

1. Make RequireJS an optional addition to the generated application.
2. Add support for optionally including Leaflet for generating application
   scaffolding that require interactive maps.
3. Update default set of tests in generate application to be more
   comprehensive.
4. Add testing coverage reports etc... for generated application.
